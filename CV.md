## About me
    My goal is to become a highly qualified programmer in the market. My tasks for the next year or two years are to acquire new knowledge, skills and abilities in the field of information technology, which I plan to solve through the study of modern, promising programming languages. My experience as a programmer is 8 years. The language stack consists of Delphi, MS SQL, a little bit of C #.
